cs2263 semester project

Our Project run through the App.java class, which acts as a GUI controller To start you can Create a user, and use that password to login, or login with username:admin, password:admin Once on the Homepage you'll see an empty listView, this can be filled with lists by pressing make list to view and add to a list simply click on the desired list in the listView. Once your viewing a list you can change sections by clicking on the section name next to the task tabel. You can manipulate tasks by selecting a task, and pressing the brown buttons along the top. You can view sublists by clicking on the sublist listView, and interact with the tasks in the same way. The Admin profile can be used only to change setting and to change the passwords of the users, simply click on a user to be taken to the password change page. In any of the main states you'll be able logout, which will save your data, and send you back to the login screen.
The program works by storing javaFx code in the different UIstate Classes,the App.java file saves the state and calls the state run method to switch between scenes. The state classes store the handle methods which calls the methods from our backend classes.
